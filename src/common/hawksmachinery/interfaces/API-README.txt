Welcome to the official Hawk's Machinery API Distributable!

In order to use this:

1. Extract this .zip file into your MCP's "src/common/" folder.
2. Do NOT run updatemd5s.bat, otherwise your mod will be reliant on HM!
3. Finally, mod Minecraft as usual.

That's about it, FML will take care of the rest.
